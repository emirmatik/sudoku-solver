# Sudoku Solver Algorithm

ðŸ’ª The algorithm solves the sudoku between 0.1 - 0.2 secs regardless its difficulty. <br/>
ðŸ¤” Due to some precedence issues on algoritm, it doesn't work properly when the difficulty is above hard level. <br/>
ðŸ‘Œ With some little optimizations on the algorithm about precedence, I suppose it'll work 100% at each difficulty. <br/>

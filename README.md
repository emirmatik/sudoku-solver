# Sudoku Solver Algorithm

ðŸ’ª The algorithm solves the sudoku between 0.1 - 0.2 secs regardless its difficulty. <br/>

ðŸ¤” Due to some priority issues on algoritm, it doesn't work properly when the difficulty is above hard level. <br/>

ðŸ‘Œ With some little priority optimizations on the algorithm, I guess that it'll work 100% at every difficulties. <br/>
